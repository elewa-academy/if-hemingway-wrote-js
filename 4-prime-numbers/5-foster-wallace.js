	[1] Numeric Storage and Retrieval System.
	[2] One step at a time.
	[3] Meaning values representing the current index are set to 0, while values of 0 are set to the current index.
	[4] Otherwise, each relevant index[a] would be flipped twice.
	[5] Also some shady business with remainder 11. But enough already.
	[6] `Array.prototype.filter` being a higher-order function defined by the EcmaScript-262 Standard (5th edition) clause 15.4.4.20[b]. Since `Number` is a built-in function that converts any value to a number and Array.prototype.filter rejects "falsey" (i.e. not "truthy") values, thus values of 0, being "falsey" (i.e. not "truthy") will not be included in the array returned by `Array.prototype.filter`. If that makes sense.
	[a] i.e. a value of n for which the quadratic in question resolves to true.
	[b] http://es5.github.io/#x15.4.4.20. All right edition 5.1 but who's counting (no question mark).
