THE ASSIGNMENT: write a function that returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
<br>
The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers whereby each new number is the sum of the previous two. By convention, the first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1.  These are the first 15 Fibonacci numbers:
<br><br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377
<br><br>
The sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known as—wait for it—Fibonacci), but in a more just world, it would be named the Pingala sequence, after the Sanskrit grammarian who documented it a thousand years earlier.
<br><br>
As we progress through the series, the ratio between successive numbers tends toward a constant (roughly 1.61803) known as the golden ratio. Some mathematically inclined  ora arrange their branches or petals according to the golden ratio—though its prevalence in nature is sometimes overstated.
