THE ASSIGNMENT: write a function that returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers whereby each new number is the sum of the previous two. By convention, the first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1.  These are the first 15 Fibonacci numbers:

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377

The sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known as—wait for it—Fibonacci), but in a more just world, it would be named the Pingala sequence, after the Sanskrit grammarian who documented it a thousand years earlier.

As we progress through the series, the ratio between successive numbers tends toward a constant (roughly 1.61803) known as the golden ratio. Some mathematically inclined  ora arrange their branches or petals according to the golden ratio—though its prevalence in nature is sometimes overstated.
