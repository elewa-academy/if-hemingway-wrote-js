<h3>If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript</h3>

<hr>

<br>
Recently I had a dream in which I assigned homework to Ernest Hemingway and 24 other literary luminaries. Each author received one of five tasks — common coding problems, mostly mathematical — they were to solve using JavaScript.
<br><br>
To my astonishment, after a few days, completed assignments started arriving in my mailbox. Still more remarkable, with the exception of Kafka’s accursed effort, they all seemed to work.  
<br><br>
Naturally, this was all too good to keep to myself, so I’ve reproduced their solutions in this book. To help put the answers in context, I’ve written a short biography of each author and a brief explanation of what I think they were up to in their code. As a respite between assignments, I’ve included some poetic interludes: long-forgotten odes documenting their author’s struggle with everyone’s favorite programming language.
<br><br>
Enjoy!
