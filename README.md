__If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript__

Recently I had a dream in which I assigned homework to Ernest Hemingway and 24 other literary luminaries. Each author received one of five tasks — common coding problems, mostly mathematical — they were to solve using JavaScript.

To my astonishment, after a few days, completed assignments started arriving in my mailbox. Still more remarkable, with the exception of Kafka’s accursed effort, they all seemed to work.  

Naturally, this was all too good to keep to myself, so I’ve reproduced their solutions in this book. To help put the answers in context, I’ve written a short biography of each author and a brief explanation of what I think they were up to in their code. As a respite between assignments, I’ve included some poetic interludes: long-forgotten odes documenting their author’s struggle with everyone’s favorite programming language.

Enjoy!
